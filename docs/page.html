    <h4>What is Sass?</h4>
    <p>Sass is a CSS preprocessor that simplifies writing CSS. It adds a lot of features of programming languages to CSS, from functions to loops and much more. Sass makes more sense when writing CSS from a human point of view, and makes it so that you stay DRY (you Don't Repeat Yourself).</p>
    <p>Sass was created in 2006 by Hampton Caitlin and Natalie Weizenbaum, and Sass files originally ended in .sass. However, in the newest version of Sass, files end in .scss. .sass files use indentation rather than brackets to indicate the nesting of selectors, use newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties, and the syntax is more similar to that of Ruby, while .scss files are more like CSS.</p>

      <li>Make sure you first have Ruby installed on your machine</li>
      <li>Run "sudo gem install sass"</li>
      <li>Write code in .scss or .sass files</li>
      <li>Run "sass [INPUT FILENAME] [OUTPUT FILENAME]" to convert to CSS</li>
    </ul>
